# MACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEW PREP
## Purpose

When Preparing for my interviews, I noticed I was not studying as efficiently as I could be. I wanted to create a ground-up comprehensive undestanding of the materials myself. It has been a great help reading dozens of math papers and books, but where am I applying these concepts over miles of code? This is why I started this. I want to really push myself to create this guide for myself over the next month or two as I apply.  

## Plan
I plan on creating folders for Mathematics, Machine learning, Deep Learning, and branch into other topics such as NLP, Computer Vision, Nueral Networks, and LLM.
This is going to be pretty extensive, but I want it to include code examples from scratch of different implementations of math topics from scratch as well.  
This will typically be in the format of Definition, Intuition, explanation, properties, and relevance.  

## Disclaimer
By no means am I an expert, I am an undergrand student finishing up his BS in computer science and minor in Applied Mathematics. There will be mistakes, but this is the reason why I'm working on this! I want to find my weaknesses and learn from them. I will update this with the path of recommended study as I expand, and all resources will be linked in here and in each folder and where they are utilized.  
## Notes for later
- build full explanation with math for ML types in TF
- build from scratch in python
- build in scikit
## Resources
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning Textbook](https://mml-book.github.io)
- [Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com) A lot of great resources from here!  
- Github Copilot for a lot of method examples and creating better explanations of my own personal understanding.
- Utilized notes from past courses
- Youtube! Will put a lot of links spaced throughout the notebooks, heavily relied on these channels to connect topics
    - [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/courses): Great Mathematic visual and intuition!
    - [JohnKrohn](https://www.youtube.com/@JonKrohnLearns/playlists): Great ML resource
