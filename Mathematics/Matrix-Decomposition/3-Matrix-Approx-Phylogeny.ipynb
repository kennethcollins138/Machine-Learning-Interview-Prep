    "## Matrix Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix approximation is a technique used in numerical analysis to approximate a given matrix with another matrix that is simpler or smaller. The goal is to find a matrix that is close to the original matrix, but is easier to work with in terms of computational efficiency or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for matrix approximation, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank-k Approximation**: This is a common method of matrix approximation where we approximate a given matrix with another matrix of rank k. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is often used for this purpose. The top k singular values and corresponding singular vectors are used to form the approximate matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Low-rank Approximation**: This is a special case of rank-k approximation where k is much smaller than the dimensions of the original matrix. This is useful in data compression and noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparse Approximation**: This method approximates a given matrix with a sparse matrix (a matrix with many zeros). This is useful when storage is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tensor Approximation**: This is a generalization of matrix approximation to higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix approximation has many applications in machine learning, data mining, image processing, and other fields where dealing with large and complex matrices is computationally expensive or impractical.\n",
