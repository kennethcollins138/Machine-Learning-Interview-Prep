    - No activation function, weights are characteristic of the output itself
    - Think of a napkin fitting around a ball
    - Retain topology of input set, kind of like a mask
    - Reveal correlations that are not easily identified
    - Unsupervised
    - No target Vector = No backpropogation
    - No lateral connection between output nodes
